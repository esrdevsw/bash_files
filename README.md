Bash Files

In this project, a program was developed to generate math tables based on user input. A selection menu was presented to the user, allowing them to choose between generating math tables or quitting the program. The program displayed a table of math operators and prompted the user to enter a math operator symbol and an operand. A while loop was used to generate the math table based on the user's input. The code performed addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponentiation on the operand and the numbers from 1 to 15. If the user entered an invalid operator symbol or operand, the program prompted the user to try again. When the user selected "Quit," the program ended and printed a closing message to the terminal.

Windows:

    Install the Git Bash terminal emulator on your Windows machine.
    Open the Git Bash terminal and navigate to the directory containing the "calcBash.sh" file using the "cd" command.
    To run the script, type "./calcBash.sh" and press Enter.

Linux:

    Open a terminal window on your Linux machine.
    Navigate to the directory containing the "calcBash.sh" file using the "cd" command.
    To run the script, type "./calcBash.sh" and press Enter.

Note: Before running the script, make sure that it has executable permissions. To give the script executable permissions, use the "chmod +x calcBash.sh" command in the terminal window.
